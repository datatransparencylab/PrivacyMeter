# About PrivacyMeter

PrivacyMeter provides a real-time privacy quantification for the modern Web. It is a browser extension that, on-the-fly, computes a relative privacy score for any website that a user is visiting. This score is computed based on each website's privacy practices and how these compare to the privacy practices of many other pre-analyzed websites. Currently, it supports four main widgets, analyzing the trackers present on the page, fingerprinting activity, amount of third-party content, and leaky web forms. In addition, the extension provides users with contextual information about all the discovered privacy issues.
